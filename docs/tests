Test 1 - Check if Columns Exist in Cleaned Data:
Objective: Verify that the clean_rentals_data function correctly cleans the provided rental data and ensures that the resulting DataFrame contains all expected columns.
Approach: Checks if all expected columns are present in the cleaned DataFrame.
Reasoning: Ensures that critical columns required for further analysis are not accidentally removed during the cleaning process.


Test 2 - Check if Data Cleaning Completes Without Error:
Objective: Confirm that the clean_airbnb_data function executes without raising any errors when provided with Airbnb data.
Approach: Executes the cleaning function with sample Airbnb data and checks for any exceptions raised.
Reasoning: Validates that the function handles Airbnb data gracefully and does not encounter any errors, ensuring robustness and reliability.


Test 3 - Check Preprocessing Completes Without Error:
Objective: Ensure that the preprocess_data function successfully completes its preprocessing operations without errors.
Approach: Applies the preprocessing function to sample data and verifies that it completes without exceptions.
Reasoning: Validates the integrity of the preprocessing function and confirms that it can handle various data formats and cleaning operations without encountering issues.
